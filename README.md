### Hi there, I'm Adam ðŸ‘‹

# About Me

I'm Adam, currently a sophomore at the University of Florida studying Mechanical Engineering. I'm interested in all things robotics, from safe autonomous systems to legged locomotion. Outside my classwork, I've built some robots and small projects, check them out below! I'm passionate about integrating robots into our world, both by advancing their technical capabilities and by building public trust and understanding.

# Projects

Here's a collection of projects, feel free to reach out with any questions or collaboration inquiries.
## Hexapod Robot
An Arduino-Mega based hexapod robot built during Summer 2023. It features 18 servos to actuate the legs, plus a radio receiver to get commands from a remote control. Plans are currently in the works to create a vision-based controller (when I get some free time ðŸ˜…).
