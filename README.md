### Hi there, I'm Adam ðŸ‘‹

# About Me

I'm Adam, currently a junior at the University of Florida studying Mechanical Engineering. I'm interested in all things robotics, from safe autonomous systems to legged locomotion. Outside my classwork, I've built some robots and small projects, check them out below! I'm passionate about integrating robots into our world, both by advancing their technical capabilities and by building public trust and understanding.

# Projects

Here's a collection of projects, feel free to reach out with any questions!
## Hexapod Robot
An Arduino-Mega based hexapod robot built during Summer 2023. It features 18 servos to actuate the legs, plus a radio receiver to get commands from a remote control. Plans are currently in the works to create a vision-based controller (when I get some free time ðŸ˜…).

## Racquetball Launcher
My latest project at the University of Florida's Machine Intelligence Lab, I developed this flywheel based racquetball launcher from scratch. After multiple design iterations, I manufactured all parts using 3D printers and a waterjet cutter. The launcher was built to be used on NaviGator 2024, a large autonomous boat

## AUV Dropper

Another of my projects for the University of Florida's Machine Intelligence Lab is this small mechanism dropper marker balls as part of the roboSub Challenge series. It was adapted from an old lab prototype, but I contributed an overhaul to the marker carrier, adding a way to reload the markers, and some quality-of-life upgrades.
